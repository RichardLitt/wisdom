# wisdom

Some bits of wisdom--much of it about programming; much of it about software engineering and NodeJS--that
I've collected and wanted to keep somewhere.


## success

[Hamming, "You and Your Research"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw)


## fundamentals-oriented thinking

[Cutting through to what matters](http://bradfield.institute/knives/)
> This is not a general disdain for the new: they want to see innovation as
> much as anybody, but are skeptical of newborn frameworks, tools and technologies
> that fail to embody the timeless principles that they've found
> most valuable.

> Frameworks descend and burn up in the atmosphere like meteors. Technology
> changes fast enough that today’s problems are never tomorrow’s problems.
> Historically, our greatest technologies have been created by those who kept
> digging until they hit bedrock; who understood foundational ideas and
> technologies well enough to improve upon them.

## problem solving

## software engineering

[How Software Gets
Bloated](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/04/05/how-software-gets-bloated/)

> It's hard to get new developers interested in a software project if we force
> them to not just learn how it works, but also how it got there, because its
> process of evolution is so critical to the final shape it ended up in. [...]
> These kinds of clever tricks incur, not a technical, but a social debt that
> strictly accrues over time.

## hacking

## node & javascript

## the unix way

[Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

https://github.com/substack/blog/blob/master/many_things.markdown

In particular:

> When frameworks make your decisions for you, you very often won't even realize
> that a decision has been made at all so it's much harder to identify problems
> when the assumptions grounded in that technology choice no longer apply.

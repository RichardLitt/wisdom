> The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it

> This has to be real." It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try
> and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it
> doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want.
> It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a
> simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to
> put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love
> instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right
> now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each
> year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the
> world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and
> we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.
